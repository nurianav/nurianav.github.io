title: Chopin
---

After a long (involuntary) pause of 6 years, I resumed my piano classes for a year. My technique wasn't very good, but I decided to record the Chopin pieces I was working on. I had to stop playing shortly after that, but I hope I'll pick it up again in the future.

This is my performance of Fantaisie-Impromptu:

And this is the Waltz no. 2 Op. 34:

I hope you enjoy them! :)
