					El método falsacionista de Popper establece criterios de demarcación entre ciencia y metafísica, y propone un procedimiento para someter a prueba la validez de las teorías científicas. Desde su punto de vista epistemológico, Popper formula críticas al marxismo, al que descalifica con variados argumentos. Este trabajo se propone analizar dicha argumentación y determinar en qué medida es posible, utilizando las propias herramientas proporcionadas por Popper, validar el método marxista, su capacidad de formular leyes científicas, de hacer predicciones fundadas en esas leyes y de resistir la comprobación histórica de las mismas.},

Su único objetivo al redactarlos es adquirir experiencia en cuanto a cómo pensar y no inventar novedosos sucedáneos con los que se pueda cerrar la brecha entre pasado y futuro . En estos ejercicios lo que importa sólo es cómo moverse en esta brecha, la única región en la que, quizá, al fin aparezca la verdad .

The mechanism of social evolution at these phases is different and is based on different institutional means of cognition and competition. At the current structural phase, competition of individuals leads to inequality, and competition of societies leads to extension of societies. Social inequality and exploitation of the periphery become institutional tools for the development. The expansion of societies and evolutionary limitations of its growth lead to life cycles of societies. The maximum size of society increases in the process of evolution and tends to cover all humankind. The Global Society is a final point of structural evolution, and transition to it is singularity. It will be a metamorphosis of the society's nature. The mechanism of further social evolution at the cognitive phase will rely directly on individual's need for cognition and self-realization, and not on the special social institutions. Mathematical model of the primary transformations dynamics at the structural phase is described by the equation T(n) = – 11214 + 1893 n, where T(n) is the moment of evolutionary transformation, and n is the ordinal number of transformation. Global singularity is predicted by this model in AD 3930.},

Su arrinconamiento institucional, que la expulsa de escuelas y universidades, tiene como contrapartida una nueva vitalidad, un deseo colectivo de cuestionar radicalmente nuestros modos de vivir y de aprender de nuevo a pensar. La filosofía nació de la discusión, de la guerra entre ciudades y de la rivalidad entre concepciones del mundo. Hoy, otra guerra ha puesto en grave crisis nuestras formas de vida y sus presupuestos. Frente a ello, la filosofía es un pensamiento que transforma la vida. Es un sistema de conceptos pero también una actitud. La filosofía es pensamiento vivo. No ofrece fórmulas o recetas, sino que pone a cada cual en la situación de pensar sus asuntos particulares como problemas comunes. ¿Cómo vivir, cómo pensar, cómo actuar? Desde estas preguntas, la filosofía no es útil ni inútil. Es necesaria. Necesaria para la vida concreta de cada uno de nosotros y para nuestras sociedades en crisis. Hay quien piensa que la filosofía debe ser protegida y defendida como si fuera una pieza de museo o una especie en extinción. Todo lo contrario: la filosofía no puede preservarse, tiene que practicarse y exponerse. No se trata de estirar el pasado de una historia moribunda sino de abrirnos al presente de una filosofía inacabada.

El fil del relat és: què hem après? Per això es parla des del singular de qui viu i es transforma amb cadascuna de les situacions recollides i des del plural dels nosaltres que li donen sentit.
Ciutat Princesa és una crònica de ciutat que recull una visió del que han estat els moviments socials que van despertar-se a la Barcelona postolímpica i a d’altres ciutats europees i que es van connectar amb les protestes i els moviments del món global fins avui. De la ciutat-marca a la globalització neoliberal i les seves crisis: quins són els mapes viscuts de les resistències?
Ciutat Princesa és un assaig de pensament en què els problemes filosòfics i polítics, així com les idees que els travessen, van a trobar les vivències concretes on arrelen i de les quals provenen. El problema del nosaltres, la qüestió del compromís, la relació entre vida política i ciutat, la crisi dels horitzons revolucionaris, etc., són elaborats aquí des de l’evolució d’una vida que descobreix la complicitat, l’experiència col·lectiva i l’amistat.},

In particular, we analyse two fundamental elements of her critique of Marxism, namely her reflections on the phenomenon of power and her critique of the theory of the unlimited development of productive forces. We do so in dialogue with two of the pioneers of the ecosocialist critique of Marx in Spain: Manuel Sacristán and Francisco Fernández Buey, both readers of Weil. The aim: to point out the relevance of this philosopher’s thought not only for its influence on some of the great ethical-political reflections of the socialist tradition in the twentieth century, but also for its ability to address the current challenges.},

	abstract = {Simone Weil had an ambivalent attitude toward Marx. While she thought that the young Marx's celebration of labor had "lyrical accents" she ultimately believed that Marx had neglected his own insights, embracing a blind worship of mechanization and a theory of history and revolution that was insufficiently attentive to the material conditions of workers. Marx, in her view, was insufficiently materialist and excessively wedded to a hierarchical model of science that maintained the domination of management. Weil and Marx's attitudes toward the dignity of labor and the necessary conditions for socialism are analyzed. The most significant cleavage between them is ultimately due to the differing manner in which they conceive of the relationship between thought and action. Through this comparison, the philosophical underpinnings of the two radically different conceptions of labor and its dignity as a human activity are explained.},

Thus, after an intense research and militancy work, it has highlighted both the importance of Karl Marx for feminist thought as well as the author's modest awareness of the situation of women in capitalism. It is from this horizon that, in this paper, we intend to reconstruct this analysis from a careful hermeneutic exegesis, centered on the Marxian conception of human nature and its inseparable link with the idea of work. We will critically reveal the limitations and the power that inhabit these ideas of Marx if we approach them from a feminist perspective. Firstly, we will examine her philosophical-anthropological developments, in which she interprets work as a vital essence, to see how her bias relegates women to the space of the natural. Later we will focus on his analysis of the concept of labour power to address the opacities that his approach presents in the way in which it is produced and reproduced. Finally, we will explore the implications that this lacuna in Marx entails around the question of social time.},

The source peaked at a bolometric luminosity of L ≃ 1.3 × 1044 erg s-1 and radiated a total energy of E ≃ 6.6 × 1050 erg over the first ∼3.5 months of observations. The early optical/UV emission of the source can be fit by a blackbody with temperature increasing from T ∼ 2 × 104 K to T ∼ 4 × 104 K while the luminosity declines from L ≃ 1.3 × 1044 erg s-1 to L ≃ 2.3 × 1043 erg s-1, requiring the photosphere to be shrinking rapidly. The optical/UV luminosity decline during this period is most consistent with an exponential decline, L∝ e{\textasciicircum}\{-(t-t\_0)/τ\}, with τ ≃ 46.5 d for t0 ≃ 57241.6 (MJD), while a power-law decline of L ∝ (t - t0)-α with t0 ≃ 57 212.3 and α = 1.62 provides a moderately worse fit. ASASSN-15oi also exhibits roughly constant soft X-ray emission that is significantly weaker than the optical/UV emission. Spectra of the source show broad helium emission lines and strong blue continuum emission in early epochs, although these features fade rapidly and are not present ∼3 months after discovery. The early spectroscopic features and colour evolution of ASASSN-15oi are consistent with a TDE, but the rapid spectral evolution is unique among optically selected TDEs.},

Of the six events found after excluding all interacting Type IIn and Ia-CSM supernovae, three (PTF09ge, 09axc, and 09djl) are coincident with the centers of their hosts, one (10iam) is offset from the center, and a precise offset cannot be determined for two (10nuj and 11glr). All the central events have similar rise times to the He-rich tidal disruption candidate PS1-10jh, and the event with the best-sampled light curve also has similar colors and power-law decay. Spectroscopically, PTF09ge is He-rich, while PTF09axc and 09djl display broad hydrogen features around peak magnitude. All three central events are in low star formation hosts, two of which are E+A galaxies. Our spectrum of the host of PS1-10jh displays similar properties. PTF10iam, the one offset event, is different photometrically and spectroscopically from the central events, and its host displays a higher star formation rate. Finding no obvious evidence for ongoing galactic nuclei activity or recent star formation, we conclude that the three central transients likely arise from the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. We compare the spectra of these events to tidal disruption candidates from the literature and find that all of these objects can be unified on a continuous scale of spectral properties. The accumulated evidence of this expanded sample strongly supports a tidal disruption origin for this class of nuclear transients.},

	abstract = {While tidal disruption events (TDEs) have long been heralded as laboratories for the study of quiescent black holes, the small number of known TDEs and uncertainties in their emission mechanism have hindered progress toward this promise. Here we present 17 new TDEs that have been detected recently by the Zwicky Transient Facility along with Swift UV and X-ray follow-up observations. Our homogeneous analysis of the optical/UV light curves, including 22 previously known TDEs from the literature, reveals a clean separation of light-curve properties with spectroscopic class. The TDEs with Bowen fluorescence features in their optical spectra have smaller blackbody radii, lower optical luminosities, and higher disruption rates compared to the rest of the sample. The small subset of TDEs that show only helium emission lines in their spectra have the longest rise times, the highest luminosities, and the lowest rates. A high detection rate of Bowen lines in TDEs with small photometric radii could be explained by the high density that is required for this fluorescence mechanism. The stellar debris can provide a source for this dense material. Diffusion of photons through this debris may explain why the rise and fade timescale of the TDEs in our sample are not correlated. We also report, for the first time, the detection of soft X-ray flares from a TDE on ∼day timescales. Based on the fact that the X-ray flares peak at a luminosity similar to the optical/UV blackbody luminosity, we attribute them to brief glimpses through a reprocessing layer that otherwise obscures the inner accretion flow.},

	abstract = {Stars in the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be ripped apart by the tidal forces of the black hole. The subsequent accretion of the stellar material causes a spectacular flare of electromagnetic radiation. Here, we provide a review of the observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs), with an emphasis on the important contributions of Swift to this field. TDEs represent a new probe of matter under strong gravity, and have opened up a new window into studying accretion physics under extreme conditions. The events probe relativistic effects, provide a new means of measuring black hole spin, and represent signposts of intermediate-mass BHs, binary BHs and recoiling BHs. Luminous, high-amplitude X-ray flares, matching key predictions of the tidal disruption scenario, have first been discovered with ROSAT, and more recently with other missions and in other wavebands. The Swift discovery of two γ-ray emitting, jetted TDEs, never seen before, has provided us with a unique probe of the early phases of jet formation and evolution, and Swift J1644+75 has the best covered lightcurve of any TDE to date. Further, Swift has made important contributions in providing well-covered lightcurves of TDEs discovered with other instruments, setting constraints on the physics that govern the TDE evolution, and including the discovery of the first candidate binary SMBH identified from a TDE lightcurve. In X-rays, TDEs probe relativistic effects (via emission-line profiles or precession effects in the Kerr metric) and the extremes of accretion physics at high rates and near the last stable orbit, and provide us with a new means of measuring BH spin. Jetted TDEs provide new insight into the formation and early evolution of radio jets, and may shed new light on related issues like the cause of the radio-loud radio-quiet dichotomy of active galactic nuclei (AGN). TDEs, once detected in large numbers, will unveil the population of IMBHs in the universe. TDE rates depend on, and therefore trace, stellar dynamics in galaxy cores on spatial scales which cannot be resolved directly. TDEs are signposts of binary SMBHs and recoiling BHs, because their rates are strongly enhanced under these conditions, and TDEs will occur off-nuclear if the SMBH is recoiling. TDEs in gas-rich environments will illuminate the circum-nuclear material, so that the reprocessed emission lines and their temporal evolution provide us with an unparalleled opportunity of reverberation mapping the cores of quiescent galaxies. Here, we present an overview of the status of observations of TDEs, highlighting the important role plaid by the Swift mission (Gehrels et al., 2004; Gehrels and Cannizzo, in press). An accompanying review by Lodato (in press) will focus on theoretical aspects of tidal disruption.},

This is a video in my new Core Concepts series -- designed to provide students and lifelong learners a brief discussion focused on one main concept from a classic philosophical text and thinker.  

This Core Concept video focuses on the introduction to Martin Heidegger's early work Being and Time, specifically on his not entirely explicitly drawn out distinction between the "ontic" (ontische) and "ontological" (ontologishe).  Here I focus on his uses of those terms particularly in sections 3 and 4 .

	abstract = {Is the neuroanatomy of the language structural connectome modulated by the life-long experience of speaking a specific language? The current study compared the brain white matter connections of the language and speech production network in a large cohort of 94 native speakers of two very different languages: an Indo-European morphosyntactically complex language (German) and a Semitic root-based language (Arabic). Using high-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI and tractography-based network statistics of the language connectome, we demonstrated that German native speakers exhibited stronger connectivity in an intra-hemispheric frontal to parietal/temporal dorsal language network, known to be associated with complex syntax processing. In comparison, Arabic native speakers showed stronger connectivity in the connections between semantic language regions, including the left temporo-parietal network, and stronger inter-hemispheric connections via the posterior corpus callosum connecting bilateral superior temporal and inferior parietal regions. The current study suggests that the structural language connectome develops and is modulated by environmental factors such as the characteristic processing demands of the native language.},

As this gas is tenuously gravitationally bound and unable to cool radiatively, only a small fraction fin ≪ 1 may accrete, with the majority instead becoming unbound in an outflow of velocity ∼104 km s-1. The outflow spreads laterally as it expands to large radii, encasing the SMBH and blocking the inner disc's EUV/X-ray radiation, which becomes trapped in a radiation-dominated nebula. Ionizing nebular radiation heats the inner edge of the ejecta, converting the emission to optical/near-UV wavelengths where photons more readily escape due to the lower opacity. This can explain the unexpectedly low and temporally constant effective temperatures of optically discovered tidal disruption event (TDE) flares. For high-mass SMBHs, M• ≳ 107 M⊙, the ejecta can become fully ionized at an earlier stage, or for a wider range of viewing angles, producing a TDE flare accompanied by thermal X-ray emission. The peak optical luminosity is suppressed as the result of adiabatic losses in the inner disc wind when M• ≪ 107 M⊙, possibly contributing to the unexpected dearth of optical TDEs in galaxies with low-mass SMBHs. In the classical picture, where fin ≈ 1, TDEs de-spin supermassive SMBHs and cap their maximum spins well below theoretical accretion physics limits.

	abstract = {We study close encounters of a 1 M ⊙ middle-age main-sequence star (modeled using MESA) with massive black holes through hydrodynamic simulations, and explore in particular the dependence of the outcomes on the black hole mass. We consider here black holes in the intermediate-mass range, M BH = 100-104 M ⊙. Possible outcomes vary from a small tidal perturbation for weak encounters all the way to partial or full disruption for stronger encounters. We find that stronger encounters lead to increased mass loss at the first pericenter passage, in many cases ejecting the partially disrupted star on an unbound orbit. For encounters that initially produce a bound system, with only partial stripping of the star, the fraction of mass stripped from the star increases with each subsequent pericenter passage and a stellar remnant of finite mass is ultimately ejected in all cases. The critical penetration depth that separates bound and unbound remnants has a dependence on the black hole mass when M BH ≲ 103 M ⊙. We also find that the number of successive close passages before ejection decreases as we go from the stellar-mass black hole to the intermediate-mass black hole regime. For instance, after an initial encounter right at the classical tidal disruption limit, a 1 M ⊙ star undergoes 16 (5) pericenter passages before ejection from a 10 M ⊙ (100 M ⊙) black hole. Observations of periodic flares from these repeated close passages could in principle indicate signatures of a partial tidal disruption event.},

Depending upon the distance at closest approach, these interactions can lead to dissipating encounters such as tidal captures and disruptions, or direct physical collisions, all of which may be accompanied by bright electromagnetic transients. In this study, we perform a wide range of hydrodynamic simulations of close encounters between black holes and main-sequence stars that collectively cover the parameter space of interest, and we identify and classify the various possible outcomes. In the case of nearly head-on collisions, the star is completely disrupted with roughly half of the stellar material becoming bound to the black hole. For more distant encounters near the classical tidal-disruption radius, the star is only partially disrupted on the first pericenter passage. Depending upon the interaction details, the partially disrupted stellar remnant may be tidally captured by the black hole or become unbound (in some cases, receiving a sufficiently large impulsive kick from asymmetric mass loss to be ejected from its host cluster). In the former case, the star will undergo additional pericenter passages before ultimately being disrupted fully. Based on the properties of the material bound to the black hole at the end of our simulations (in particular, the total bound mass and angular momentum), we comment upon the expected accretion process and associated electromagnetic signatures that are likely to result.},

	abstract = {Highly energetic stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a way to study black hole characteristics and their environment. We simulate TDEs with the PHANTOM code in a general relativistic and Newtonian description of a supermassive black hole's gravity. Stars, which are placed on parabolic orbits with different parameters \${\textbackslash}beta\$, are constructed with the stellar evolution code MESA and therefore have realistic stellar density profiles. We study the mass fallback rate of the debris \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\$ and its dependence on the \${\textbackslash}beta\$, stellar mass and age as well as the black hole's spin and the choice of the gravity's description. We calculate peak value \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{peak\}\$, time to the peak \$t\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{peak\}\$, duration of the super-Eddington phase \$t\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Edd\}\$, time \$t\_\{{\textgreater}0.5{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{peak\}\}\$ during which \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}{\textgreater}0.5{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{peak\}\$, early rise-time \${\textbackslash}tau\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rise\}\$ and late-time slope \$n\_{\textbackslash}infty\$. We recover the trends of \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{peak\}\$, \$t\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{peak\}\$, \${\textbackslash}tau\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rise\}\$ and \$n\_{\textbackslash}infty\$ with \${\textbackslash}beta\$, stellar mass and age, which were obtained in previous studies. We find that \$t\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Edd\}\$, at a fixed \${\textbackslash}beta\$, scales primarily with the stellar mass, while \$t\_\{{\textgreater}0.5{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{peak\}\}\$ scales with the compactness of stars. The effect of SMBH's rotation depends on the orientation of its rotational axis relative to the direction of the stellar motion on the initial orbit. Encounters on prograde orbits result in narrower \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\$ curves with higher \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{peak\}\$, while the opposite occurs for retrograde orbits. We find that disruptions, at the same pericenter distance, are stronger in a relativistic tidal field than in a Newtonian. Therefore, relativistic \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\$ curves have higher \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{peak\}\$, and shorter \$t\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{peak\}\$ and \$t\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Edd\}\$.},

	abstract = {The disruption of stars by supermassive black holes has been linked to more than a dozen flares in the cores of galaxies out to redshift z {\textasciitilde} 0.4. Modeling these flares properly requires a prediction of the rate of mass return to the black hole after a disruption. Through hydrodynamical simulation, we show that aside from the full disruption of a solar mass star at the exact limit where the star is destroyed, the common assumptions used to estimate {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}(t), the rate of mass return to the black hole, are largely invalid. While the analytical approximation to tidal disruption predicts that the least-centrally concentrated stars and the deepest encounters should have more quickly-peaked flares, we find that the most-centrally concentrated stars have the quickest-peaking flares, and the trend between the time of peak and the impact parameter for deeply penetrating encounters reverses beyond the critical distance at which the star is completely destroyed. We also show that the most-centrally concentrated stars produced a characteristic drop in {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}(t) shortly after peak when a star is only partially disrupted, with the power law index n being as extreme as -4 in the months immediately following the peak of a flare. Additionally, we find that n asymptotes to {\textasciitilde}= - 2.2 for both low- and high-mass stars for approximately half of all stellar disruptions. Both of these results are significantly steeper than the typically assumed n = -5/3. As these precipitous decay rates are only seen for events in which a stellar core survives the disruption, they can be used to determine if an observed tidal disruption flare produced a surviving remnant. We provide fitting formulae for four fundamental quantities of tidal disruption as functions of the star's distance to the black hole at pericenter and its stellar structure: the total mass lost, the time of peak, the accretion rate at peak, and the power-law index shortly after peak. These results should be taken into consideration when flares arising from tidal disruptions are modeled.},

These flares are set into motion when a star is torn apart by the tidal field of a massive black hole, triggering a chain of events which is - so far - incompletely understood. However, the disruption process has been studied extensively for almost half a century, and unlike the later stages of a TDE, our understanding of the disruption itself is reasonably well converged. In this Chapter, we review both analytical and numerical models for stellar tidal disruption. Starting with relatively simple, order-of-magnitude physics, we review models of increasing sophistication, the semi-analytic "affine formalism," hydrodynamic simulations of the disruption of polytropic stars, and the most recent hydrodynamic results concerning the disruption of realistic stellar models. Our review surveys the immediate aftermath of disruption in both typical and more unusual TDEs, exploring how the fate of the tidal debris changes if one considers non-main sequence stars, deeply penetrating tidal encounters, binary star systems, and sub-parabolic orbits. The stellar tidal disruption process provides the initial conditions needed to model the formation of accretion flows around quiescent massive black holes, and in some cases may also lead to directly observable emission, for example via shock breakout, gravitational waves or runaway nuclear fusion in deeply plunging TDEs.},

	abstract = {The development of a new generation of theoretical models for tidal disruptions is timely, as increasingly diverse events are being captured in surveys of the transient sky. Recently, Gezari et al. reported a discovery of a new class of tidal disruption events: the disruption of a helium-rich stellar core, thought to be a remnant of a red giant (RG) star. Motivated by this discovery and in anticipation of others, we consider tidal interaction of an RG star with a supermassive black hole (SMBH) which leads to the stripping of the stellar envelope and subsequent inspiral of the compact core toward the black hole. Once the stellar envelope is removed the inspiral of the core is driven by tidal heating as well as the emission of gravitational radiation until the core either falls into the SMBH or is tidally disrupted. In the case of the tidal disruption candidate PS1-10jh, we find that there is a set of orbital solutions at high eccentricities in which the tidally stripped hydrogen envelope is accreted by the SMBH before the helium core is disrupted. This places the RG core in a portion of parameter space where strong tidal heating can lift the degeneracy of the compact remnant and disrupt it before it reaches the tidal radius. We consider how this sequence of events explains the puzzling absence of the hydrogen emission lines from the spectrum of PS1-10jh and gives rise to its other observational features.},

	abstract = {When a star approaches a black hole closely, it may be pulled apart by gravitational forces in a tidal disruption event (TDE). The ﬂares produced by TDEs are unique tracers of otherwise quiescent supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located at the centre of most galaxies. In particular, the appearance of such ﬂares and the subsequent decay of the light curve are both sensitive to whether the star is partially or totally destroyed by the tidal ﬁeld. However, the physics of the disruption and the fallback of the debris are still poorly understood. We are here modelling the hydrodynamical evolution of realistic stars as they approach an SMBH on parabolic orbits, using for the ﬁrst time the moving-mesh code AREPO, which is particularly well adapted to the problem through its combination of quasi-Lagrangian behaviour, low advection errors, and high accuracy typical of mesh-based techniques. We examine a suite of simulations with different impact parameters, allowing us to determine the critical distance at which the star is totally disrupted, the energy distribution and the fallback rate of the debris, as well as the hydrodynamical evolution of the stellar remnant in the case of a partial disruption. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that the internal evolution of the remnant’s core is strongly inﬂuenced by persistent vortices excited in the tidal interaction. These should be sites of strong magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation, and the associated mixing may profoundly alter the subsequent evolution of the tidally pruned star.},

Upcoming missions will detect thousands of tidal disruption events (TDEs), and accurate theoretical modeling is required to interpret the data with precision. Here we analyze the influence of more realistic stellar structure on the outcome of TDEs; in particular, we compare the fallback rates—being the rate at which tidally disrupted debris returns to the black hole—from progenitors generated with the stellar evolution code mesa to and γ = 5/3 polytropes. We find that mesa-generated density profiles yield qualitatively different fallback rates as compared to polytropic approximations, and that only the fallback curves from low-mass (1 M⊙ or less), zero-age main-sequence stars are well fit by either a or 5/3 polytrope. Stellar age has a strong affect on the shape of the fallback curve, and can produce characteristic timescales (e.g., the time to the peak of the fallback rate) that greatly differ from the polytropic values. We use these differences to assess the degree to which the inferred black hole mass from the observed light curve can deviate from the true value, and find that the discrepancy can be at the order of magnitude level. Accurate stellar structure also leads to a substantial variation in the critical impact parameter at which the star is fully disrupted, and can increase the susceptibility of the debris stream to fragmentation under its own self-gravity. These results suggest that detailed modeling is required to accurately interpret observed light curves of TDEs.},

	abstract = {We present the first simulations of the tidal disruption of stars with realistic structures and compositions by massive black holes (BHs). We build stars in the stellar evolution code MESA and simulate their disruption in the 3D adaptive-mesh hydrodynamics code FLASH, using an extended Helmholtz equation of state and tracking 49 elements. We study the disruption of a 1M⊙ star and 3M⊙ star at zero-age main sequence (ZAMS), middle-age, and terminal-age main sequence (TAMS). The maximum BH mass for tidal disruption increases by a factor of ∼2 from stellar radius changes due to main-sequence (MS) evolution; this is equivalent to varying BH spin from 0 to 0.75. The shape of the mass fallback rate curves is different from the results for polytropes of Guillochon \& Ramirez-Ruiz. The peak timescale tpeak increases with stellar age, while the peak fallback rate decreases with age, and these effects diminish with increasing impact parameter β. For a β = 1 disruption of a 1M⊙ star by a 106 M⊙ BH, from ZAMS to TAMS, tpeak increases from 30 to 54 days, while decreases from 0.66 to 0.14 M⊙ yr−1. Compositional anomalies in nitrogen, helium, and carbon can occur before the peak timescale for disruptions of MS stars, which is in contrast to predictions from the “frozen-in” model. More massive stars can show stronger anomalies at earlier times, meaning that compositional constraints can be key in determining the mass of the disrupted star. The abundance anomalies predicted by these simulations provide a natural explanation for the spectral features and varying line strengths observed in tidal disruption events.},

	abstract = {We construct a menu of objects that can give rise to bright flares when disrupted by massive black holes (BHs), ranging from planets to evolved stars. Through their tidal disruption, main sequence and evolved stars can effectively probe the existence of otherwise quiescent supermassive BHs, and white dwarfs can probe intermediate mass BHs. Many low-mass white dwarfs possess extended hydrogen envelopes, which allow for the production of prompt flares in disruptive encounters with moderately massive BHs of 105–—masses that may constitute the majority of massive BHs by number. These objects are a missing link in two ways: (1) for probing moderately massive BHs and (2) for understanding the hydrodynamics of the disruption of objects with tenuous envelopes. A flare arising from the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by a reaches a maximum between 0.6 and 11 days, with a peak fallback rate that is usually super-Eddington and results in a flare that is likely brighter than a typical tidal disruption event. Encounters stripping only the envelope can provide hydrogen-only fallback, while encounters disrupting the core evolve from H- to He-rich fallback. While most tidal disruption candidates observed thus far are consistent with the disruptions of main sequence stars, the rapid timescales of nuclear transients such as Dougie and PTF10iya are naturally explained by the disruption of low-mass white dwarfs. As the number of observed flares continues to increase, the menu presented here will be essential for characterizing nuclear BHs and their environments through tidal disruptions.},

We introduce a new analytic model for tidal disruption events (TDEs) to analyse the dependence of these events on β, the ratio of the tidal radius to the orbital pericentre. We ﬁnd, contrary to most previous work, that the spread in debris energy for a TDE is largely constant for all β. This result has important consequences for optical transient searches targeting TDEs, which we discuss. We quantify leading-order general relativistic corrections to this spread in energy and ﬁnd that they are small. We also examine the role of stellar spin and ﬁnd that a combination of spin–orbit misalignment, rapid rotation and high β may alter the spread in debris energy. Finally, we quantify for the ﬁrst time the gravitational wave emission due to the strong compression of a star in a high-β TDE. Although this signal is unlikely to be detectable for disruptions of main-sequence stars, the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole can produce a strong signal visible to Advanced LIGO at tens of megaparsecs.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we revisit the arguments for the basis of the time evolution of the flares expected to arise when a star is disrupted by a supermassive black hole. We present a simple analytic model relating the light curve to the internal density structure of the star. We thus show that the standard light curve proportional to t-5/3 only holds at late times. Close to the peak luminosity the light curve is shallower, deviating more strongly from t-5/3 for more centrally concentrated (e.g. solar type) stars. We test our model numerically by simulating the tidal disruption of several stellar models, described by simple polytropic spheres with index γ. The simulations agree with the analytical model given two considerations. First, the stars are somewhat inflated on reaching pericentre because of the effective reduction of gravity in the tidal field of the black hole. This is well described by a homologous expansion by a factor which becomes smaller as the polytropic index becomes larger. Secondly, for large polytropic indices wings appear in the tails of the energy distribution, indicating that some material is pushed further away from parabolic orbits by shocks in the tidal tails. In all our simulations, the t-5/3 light curve is achieved only at late stages. In particular, we predict that for solar-type stars, this happens only after the luminosity has dropped by at least 2mag from the peak. We discuss our results in the light of recent observations of flares in otherwise quiescent galaxies and note the dependence of these results on further parameters, such as the star/hole mass ratio and the stellar orbit.},

We show that the missing objects are low-mass giants and asymptotic giant branch stars in the range 1-3Msolar. Using detailed stellar evolution calculations, we find that to prevent these objects from evolving to become visible in the depleted K bands, we require that they suffer collisions on the red giant branch, and we calculate the fractional envelope mass losses required. Using a combination of smoothed particle hydrodynamic calculations, restricted three-body analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we compute the expected collision rates between giants and black holes, and between giants and main-sequence stars in the Galactic Centre. We show that collisions can plausibly explain the missing giants in the 10.5 {\textless} K {\textless} 12 band. However, depleting the brighter (K {\textless} 10.5) objects out to the required radius would require a large population of black hole impactors which would in turn deplete the 10.5 {\textless} K {\textless} 12 giants in a region much larger than is observed. We conclude that collisions with stellar-mass black holes cannot account for the depletion of the very brightest giants, and we use our results to place limits on the population of stellar-mass black holes in the Galactic Centre.},

One-dimensional simulations of red and asymptotic giant branch stars with mass loss rates from \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ up to a few {\textbackslash}msun/yr show in no case any significant radius increase. The largest radius increase of 0.2\% was found in the case with the lowest mass loss rate. For dynamical-timescale mass loss rates, that may be encountered during a common envelope phase, the evolution is not adiabatic. The superadiabatic outer layer of the giant's envelope has a local thermal timescale comparable to the dynamical timescale. Therefore, this layer has enough time to readjust thermally. Moreover, the giant star is driven out of hydrostatic equilibrium and evolves dynamically. In these cases no increase of the stellar radius with respect to its initial value is found. If the mass loss rate is high enough, the superadiabaticity of the outer layer is lost progressively and a radiative zone forms due to a combination of thermal and dynamical readjustment. Conditions for unstable mass transfer based on adiabatic mass loss models that predict a significant radius increase, may need to be re-evaluated.},

On the other hand, stars in thermal equilibrium with subadiabatic surface layers are linearly stable for any value of the mass ratio. A finite-amplitude instability exists to which radiative stars are subject. If the initial phases of mass transfer are sufficiently rapid, such a star may undergo a delayed transition to dynamical time scale mass loss.

	abstract = {The volume behind the black hole horizon was suggested as a holographic dual for the quantum computational complexity of the boundary state in AdS/CFT. This identification is strongly motivated by the switchback effect: a characteristic delay of complexity growth in reaction to an inserted perturbation, modelled as a shockwave in the bulk. Recent proposals of de Sitter (dS) holography suggest that a dual theory could be living on a stretched horizon near the cosmological horizon. We study how the spacetime volume behind the cosmological horizon in Schwarzschild-dS space reacts to the insertion of shockwaves in an attempt to characterize the properties of this dual theory. We demonstrate that a switchback effect can be observed in dS space. That is, the growth of complexity is delayed in reaction to a perturbation. This delay is longer for earlier shocks and depends on a scrambling time which is logarithmic in the strength of the shockwave and proportional to the inverse temperature of the cosmological dS horizon. This behavior is very similar to what happens for AdS black holes, albeit the geometric origin of the effect is somewhat different.},

In the crowded environment of galactic nuclei, the two-body interactions alter the distribution of stars on long timescales, making them drift in energy and angular momentum. We present a simplified analytical treatment of the scattering processes in galactic stellar nuclei, assuming all stars have the same mass. We have discussed how the interplay between two-body relaxation and GW emission modifies the slope of the inner stellar cusp within the SMBH sphere of influence, and calculated the rates of tidal disruption events (TDEs) and main-sequence extreme-mass ratio inspirals (MS-EMRIs) of stars that are tidally disrupted by the SMBH. We find that typically the ratio of the TDE and MS-EMRI rates is the square of the ratio of the tidal and Schwarzschild radii. For our Galaxy, this implies that the rate of MS-EMRIs is just about a percent of the TDE rate. We then consider the role of stars injected on highly eccentric orbits in the vicinity of the SMBH due to the Hills binary disruption mechanism, and show that the MS-EMRI rate can almost approach the TDE rate if the binary fraction at the SMBH influence radius is close to unity. Finally, we discuss how physical stellar collisions affect a large area of phase space.},

	abstract = {Sun-like stars are thought to be regularly disrupted by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within galactic nuclei. Yet, as stars evolve off the main sequence their vulnerability to tidal disruption increases drastically as they develop a bifurcated structure consisting of a dense core and a tenuous envelope. Here we present the first hydrodynamic simulations of the tidal disruption of giant stars and show that the core has a substantial influence on the star's ability to survive the encounter. Stars with more massive cores retain large fractions of their envelope mass, even in deep encounters. Accretion flares resulting from the disruption of giant stars should last for tens to hundreds of years. Their characteristic signature in transient searches would not be the t -5/3 decay typically associated with tidal disruption events, but a correlated rise over many orders of magnitude in brightness on timescales of months to years. We calculate the relative disruption rates of stars of varying evolutionary stages in typical galactic centers, then use our results to produce Monte Carlo realizations of the expected flaring event populations. We find that the demographics of tidal disruption flares are strongly dependent on both stellar and black hole mass, especially near the limiting SMBH mass scale of {\textasciitilde}108 M ⊙. At this black hole mass, we predict a sharp transition in the SMBH flaring diet beyond which all observable disruptions arise from evolved stars, accompanied by a dramatic cutoff in the overall tidal disruption flaring rate. Black holes less massive than this limiting mass scale will show observable flares from both main-sequence and evolved stars, with giants contributing up to 10\% of the event rate. The relative fractions of stars disrupted at different evolutionary states can constrain the properties and distributions of stars in galactic nuclei other than our own.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a series of papers presenting a quantitative theory for the tidal disruption of main-sequence stars by supermassive black holes. Using fully general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations and MESA-model initial conditions, we explore the pericenter-dependence of tidal disruption properties for eight stellar masses ( \$0.15{\textbackslash}leqslant \{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}/\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textbackslash}leqslant 10\$ ) and six black hole masses ( \$\{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{5\}{\textbackslash}leqslant \{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BH\}\}/\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textbackslash}leqslant 5{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{7\}\$ ). We present here the results most relevant to observations. The effects of internal stellar structure and relativity decouple for both the disruption cross section and the characteristic energy width of the debris. Moreover, the full disruption cross section is almost independent of M⋆ for M⋆/M⊙ ≲ 3. Independent of M⋆, relativistic effects increase the critical pericenter distance for full disruption events by up to a factor of ∼3 relative to the Newtonian prediction. The probability of a direct capture is also independent of M⋆; at MBH/M⊙ ≃ 5 × 106 this probability is equal to the probability of a complete disruption. The breadth of the debris energy distribution ΔE can differ from the standard estimate by factors of 0.35 - 2, depending on M⋆ and MBH, implying a corresponding change (∝(ΔE)-3/2) in the characteristic mass-return timescale. We provide analytic forms, suitable for use in both event rate estimates and parameter inference, to describe all these trends. For partial disruptions, we find a nearly universal relation between the star's angular momentum and the fraction of M⋆ remaining. Within the "empty loss-cone" regime, partial disruptions must precede full disruptions. These partial disruptions can drastically affect the rate and appearance of subsequent total disruptions.},

	abstract = {We study the correlations between the dynamical history of a star that eventually experiences a tidal disruption event (TDE) and the properties of the TDE itself. As expected, we ﬁnd that (i) in empty loss cone at the radius of inﬂuence, most TDEs are non-violent TDEs; i.e. the star’s periastron is only a bit smaller than the tidal radius. These stars had experienced strong tidal interactions with the supermassive black hole (SMBH), just slightly outside the tidal radius. (ii) In full loss cone at the radius of inﬂuence, most TDEs are violent; i.e. the star’s periastron is signiﬁcantly smaller than the tidal radius. These stars did not previously encounter strong tidal effects. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that even in extremely empty or extremely full loss cone a ﬁnite fraction of order ∼10 per cent of the events are non-typical. This is due to two surprising effects: (i) In an empty loss cone, a logarithmic fraction of the events are associated with stars that entered the loss cone via strong scatterings. Those events are usually violent penetrating deep into the loss cone. (ii) In full loss cone, orbits with semimajor axis smaller than the radius of inﬂuence, where the loss cone is marginally empty, dominate the TDE rate. As a result, a constant fraction of TDEs involve stars in empty loss cone orbits, which have typically experienced strong interactions with the SMBH in previous orbits.},

We find that the convective pre-mixing scheme is the preferable algorithm. The masses of the convective core in the case of the predictive mixing and the combined convective and semiconvective regions in the case of the convective pre-mixing scheme are higher than in the models with only the Ledoux criterion, but they are still lower than the seismic-derived values. Both algorithms are promising and alternative methods of studying models of subdwarf B stars.},

We explored variations of factors known to aﬀect the radial expansion of massive stars (e.g., semiconvection, overshooting, or rotation).

	abstract = {One--dimensional stellar structure and evolution programs are built using different physical prescriptions and algorithms, which means there can be variations between models' predictions even when using identical input physics. This leads to questions about whether such deviations are physical or numerical; code validation studies are important and necessary tools for studying these questions. We provide the first direct comparison between the Monash stellar evolution program and MESA for a \$2M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ model evolved from the zero-age main sequence to the tip of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch. We compare the internal structure of the two models at six critical evolutionary points and find that they are in excellent agreement in characteristics like central temperature, central density and the temperature at the base of the convective envelope during the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch. The hydrogen-exhausted core mass between the models differs by less than 4.2\% throughout the entire evolution, the final values vary only by 1.5\%. Surface quantities such as luminosity and radius vary by less than 0.2\% prior to the asymptotic giant branch. During thermal pulses, the difference extends to 3.4\%, largely due to uncertainties in mixing and the treatment of atmospheric boundary conditions. Given that the veteran Monash code is closed source, the present work provides the first fully open-source computational analog. This increases accessibility to precision modeling on the asymptotic giant branch and lays the groundwork for higher-mass calculations that are performed with MESA but preserve the standards of the Monash code during the AGB.},

Long near-uninterrupted high-precision photometric timeseries observations from dedicated space missions such as CoRoT and Kepler have provided seismic inferences of the global and internal properties of a large number of evolved stars, including red giants. These inferences are confronted with predictions from theoretical models to improve our understanding of stellar structure and evolution. Our knowledge and understanding of red giants have indeed increased tremendously using these seismic inferences, and we anticipate that more information is still hidden in the data. Unraveling this will further improve our understanding of stellar evolution. This will also have significant impact on our knowledge of the Milky Way Galaxy as well as on exo-planet host stars. The latter is important for our understanding of the formation and structure of planetary systems.},

	abstract = {We establish new constraints on the intermediate-mass range of the initial-final mass relation, and apply the results to study the evolution of stars on the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB). These constraints derive from newly discovered (bright) white dwarfs in the nearby Hyades and Praesepe star clusters, including a total of 18 high signal-to-noise ratio measurements with progenitor masses of M initial = 2.8-3.8 M ⊙. We also include a new analysis of existing white dwarfs in the older NGC 6819 and NGC 7789 star clusters, M initial = 1.6 and 2.0 M ⊙. Over this range of initial masses, stellar evolutionary models for metallicity Z initial = 0.02 predict the maximum growth of the core of TP-AGB stars. By comparing the newly measured remnant masses to the robust prediction of the core mass at the first thermal pulse on the AGB (i.e., from stellar interior models), we establish several findings. First, we show that the stellar core mass on the AGB grows rapidly from 10\% to 30\% for stars with M initial = 1.6 to 2.0 M ⊙. At larger masses, the core-mass growth decreases steadily to {\textasciitilde}10\% at M initial = 3.4 M ⊙, after which there is a small hint of a upturn out to M initial = 3.8 M ⊙. These observations are in excellent agreement with predictions from the latest TP-AGB evolutionary models in Marigo et al. We also compare to models with varying efficiencies of the third dredge-up and mass loss, and demonstrate that the process governing the growth of the core is largely the stellar wind, while the third dredge-up plays a secondary, but non-negligible role. Based on the new white dwarf measurements, we perform an exploratory calibration of the most popular mass-loss prescriptions in the literature, as well as of the third dredge-up efficiency as a function of the stellar mass. Finally, we estimate the lifetime and the integrated luminosity of stars on the TP-AGB to peak at t {\textasciitilde} 3 Myr and E = 1.2 × 1010 L ⊙ yr for M initial {\textasciitilde} 2 M ⊙ (t {\textasciitilde} 2 Myr for luminosities brighter than the red giant branch tip at log (L/L ⊙) {\textgreater} 3.4), decreasing to t = 0.4 Myr and E = 6.1 × 109 L ⊙ yr for stars with M initial {\textasciitilde} 3.5 M ⊙. The implications of these results are discussed, especially with respect to general studies aimed at characterizing the integrated light output of TP-AGB stars in population synthesis models.},

In this pedagogical review, we present the geometric approach to complexity advocated by Nielsen and show how it can be used to deﬁne complexity for generic quantum systems; in particular, we focus on Gaussian states in QFT, both pure and mixed, and on certain classes of CFT states. We then present the conjectured relation to gravitational quantities within the holographic correspondence and discuss several examples in which different versions of the conjectures have been tested. We highlight the relation between complexity, chaos and scrambling in chaotic systems. We conclude with a discussion of open problems and future directions.

The principles of AGB evolution have been investigated in recent years leading to improved and refined models, for example with regard to hot-bottom burning or the third dredge-up. The postprocessing s-process model yields quantitative results that reproduce many observations. However, these and most other processes in AGB stars are intimately related to the physics of stellar mixing. Mixing in AGB stars is currently not well-enough understood for accurate yield predictions. Several constraints and methods are available to improve the models. Some regimes of AGB evolution have not yet been studied in sufficient detail. These include the super-AGB stars and AGB stars at extremely low or ultra low metallicity.},

	abstract = {The influence of extended convective mixing (overshoot) on asymptotic giant branch stellar evolution is investigated in detail. The extended mixing is treated time-dependently, and the efficiency declines exponentially with the geometric distance from the convective boundary. It has been considered at all convective boundaries, including the He-flash convection zone in the intershell region which forms during the thermal pulses. Both the structural and the chemical evolution are affected by the inclusion of overshoot. The main results include a very efficient third dredge-up which leads to the formation of carbon stars of low mass and luminosity. A 13C pocket which may serve as a neutron source for the s-process can form after the third dredge-up has reached into the 12C rich intershell. Overshoot applied to the pulse-driven convective zone during the He-flash leads to a deeper penetration of the bottom of this convective zone into the C/O core below the He-burning shell. This in turn causes 4He to be less abundant in the intershell while 12C and 16O are more abundant compared to calculations without overshoot. We show that overshoot at the He-flash convection zone as well as at the base of the envelope convection enhance the efficiency of the third dredge-up. Characteristic properties of the structural and chemical evolution of AGB stars are presented.},

Mass loss has been taken into account with different descriptions for the RGB, AGB and post-AGB phase. On the AGB we considered mass loss with a formula based on dynamical calculations of the atmospheres of Mira-like stars. Our results are consistent with empirical initial-final mass relations. It is shown that hot bottom burning and mass loss are closely connected. The overluminosity as well as the nucleosynthesis of hot bottom burning models can depend sensitively on mass loss. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of mass loss on the internal structure reached at the tip of the AGB, and emphasize that post-AGB timescales will depend strongly on the AGB history, i.e. on the initial mass and the applied mass-loss law.},

	abstract = {We calculate the dust formed around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and super-AGB stars of metallicity Z = 0.008 by following the evolution of models with masses in the range 1 M⊙ ≤ M ≤ 8 M⊙ through the thermal pulses phase, assuming that dust forms via condensation of molecules within a wind expanding isotropically from the stellar surface. We find that, because of the strong hot bottom burning (HBB) experienced, high-mass models produce silicates, whereas lower mass objects are predicted to be surrounded by carbonaceous grains; the transition between the two regimes occurs at a threshold mass of 3.5 M⊙. These findings are consistent with the results presented in a previous investigation, for Z = 0.001. However, in the present higher metallicity case, the production of silicates in the more massive stars continues for the whole AGB phase, because the HBB experienced is softer at Z = 0.008 than at Z = 0.001; thus, the oxygen in the envelope, essential for the formation of water molecules, is never consumed completely. The total amount of dust formed for a given mass experiencing HBB increases with metallicity, because of the higher abundance of silicon, and the softer HBB, both factors favouring a higher rate of silicates production. This behaviour is not found in low-mass stars, because the carbon enrichment of the stellar surface layers, due to repeated third dredge-up episodes, is almost independent of the metallicity. Regarding cosmic dust enrichment by intermediate-mass stars, we find that the cosmic yield at Z = 0.008 is a factor of ∼5 larger than at Z = 0.001. In the lower metallicity case carbon dust dominates after ∼300 Myr, but at Z = 0.008 the dust mass is dominated by silicates at all times, with a prompt enrichment occurring after ∼40 Myr, associated with the evolution of stars with masses M ∼ 7.5-8 M⊙. These conclusions are partly dependent on the assumptions concerning the two important macrophysics inputs needed to describe the AGB phase, and still unknown from first principles: the treatment of convection, which determines the extent of the HBB experienced and of the third dredge-up following each thermal pulse, and mass-loss, essential in fixing the time-scale on which the stellar envelope is lost from the star.},

Until recently, it was generally believed that black holes in nature appear in two broad mass ranges: stellar-mass (M{\textasciitilde}3 20 M⊙), which are produced by the core collapse of massive stars, and supermassive (M{\textasciitilde}106 1010 M⊙), which are found in the centers of galaxies and are produced by a still uncertain combination of processes. In the last few years, however, evidence has accumulated for an intermediate-mass class of black holes, with M{\textasciitilde}102 104 M⊙. If such objects exist they have important implications for the dynamics of stellar clusters, the formation of supermassive black holes, and the production and detection of gravitational waves. We review the evidence for intermediate-mass black holes and discuss future observational and theoretical work that will help clarify numerous outstanding questions about these objects.},

The paths in the HertzsprungRussell diagram, the relationship between interior processes and changes in external characteristics, and the relative time scales associated with different evolutionary phases are qualitatively quite similar for the two stars. Quantitative differences (in addition to a considerable difference in absolute time scales) are of importance. In 5 Alo evolution there are two major phases of core helium burning separated in the H-R diagram by a short phase of rapid transit; the path in the H-R diagram during core helium burning extends to higher surface temperatures in the S i'fo case, crossing the region of classical Cepheids; at the red-giant tip, the convective envelope is shallower in the 5 Alo case, leading to a less pronounced increase in the surface ratio of N14 to C11, although the reduction in the surface abundance of Li is about the same as in the 3 Alo case. The effect of the uncertainty in the Cu(n, y)OlI reaction rate is investigated. It is found that, by reducing the C1I(n, )O16 cross-section, the maximum surface temperature reached during the core helium-burmag phase is decreased. The total time spent in core helium burning is reduced and the final core concentration of C12 is considerably enhanced relative to the final core concentration of 016. It is shmvi that the primary maximum found in the number versus magnitude distribution of the classical Cepheids (in any galaxy with a large component of young population I stars) is to he expected as a result of passages through a postulated instability strip during core helium burning.},

During the hydrogen-burning phase near the main sequence, C'2 is converted into N'4 and Li is destroyed over a large fraction of the stellar interior. 016 is slowly converted into N'4 in the core. During the rise toward the red-giant tip immediately preceding the ignition of helium in the core, the extension of a convection envelope almost to the hydrogen- burning shell then leads to an increase in the surface ratio of N14 to C32 by a factor of 3.2 and to a decrease in the surface abundance of Li by a factor of 60. Surface abundances do not change further during core helium burning. Comparison with the surface Li abundance of Capella F and G permits an inference concerning the average rate of mass loss from the surface of a 3 Mo star.},

Low- and intermediate-mass stars release their nucleosynthesis products through stellar outflows or winds, in contrast to massive stars that explode as core-collapse supernovae. Here we review the stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis for single stars up to {\textasciitilde} 10 M⊙ from the main sequence through to the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). We include a discussion of the main uncertainties that affect theoretical calculations and review the latest observational data, which are used to constrain uncertain details of the stellar models.

The distribution of the stars as a function of J is determined for small J by considering the rate at which stars of fixed E enter the loss cone; a Fokker-Planck equation in E alone and containing an energy-dependent 'sink' term is obtained by integrating the two-dimensional equation over J and substituting an expression for the stellar consumption rate; and the approximate steady-state solution to this equation in the 'self-similar' regime is found along with the total rate at which the central object consumes stars.

We discuss the energy balance in the general setting, and in application to the Bahcall–Wolf cusp around a central black hole, for which we derive a perturbative solution. We stress that the cusp is not a steady-state structure, but rather evolves in amplitude while retaining an approximately r µ r-7 4 density proﬁle. Finally, we apply the method to the nuclear star cluster of the milky Way, and illustrate a possible evolutionary scenario in which a two-component system of lighter main-sequence stars and stellar-mass black holes develops a Bahcall–Wolf cusp in the heavier component and a weaker r µ r-3 2 cusp in the lighter, visible component, over the period of several Gyr. The present-day density proﬁle is consistent with the recently detected mild cusp inside the central parsec, and is weakly sensitive to initial conditions.},

A correlation between solarN and black hole mass M is exploited to estimate the rate of tidal disruptions in the local Universe.

The rate of tidal disruptions could be high enough to be detected in supernova (or similar) monitoring campaigns - we estimate the rate of tidal disruptions to be 0.01-0.1 times the supernova rate.

Considering two-dimensional angular momentum space, we focus on 'empty loss cone' systems, where the typical scattering during a dynamical time jd is smaller than the size of the loss cone jlc. As a result, the occupation number within the loss cone is significantly smaller than outside. Classical diffusive treatment of this regime predict exponentially small occupation number deep in the loss cone. We revisit this classical derivation of occupancy distribution of objects in the empty loss cone regime. We emphasize the role of the rare large scatterings and show that the occupancy does not decay exponentially within the loss cone, but it is rather flat, with a typical value ∼[(jd/jlc)]2ln -2(jlc/jmin ) compared to the occupation in circular angular momentum (where jmin is the smallest possible scattering). Implication are that although the loss cone for tidal break of Giants or binaries is typically empty, tidal events that occur significantly inside the loss cone (β ≳ 2) are almost as common as those with β ≅ 1, where β is the ratio between the tidal radius and the periastron. The probability for event with penetration factor {\textgreater}β decreases only as β-1 rather than exponentially. This effect has no influence on events characterized by full loss cone, such as tidal disruption event of ∼1 m⊙ main-sequence star.},

The detection of flares from tidally disrupted stars could confirm that these objects are black holes (BHs). Here we present calculations of the stellar disruption rates in detailed dynamical models of real galaxies, taking into account the refilling of the loss cone of stars on disruptable orbits by two-body relaxation and tidal forces in non-spherical galaxies. The highest disruption rates (one star per 104yr) occur in faint (L{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1010Lsolar) galaxies, which have steep central density cusps. More luminous galaxies are less dense and have much longer relaxation times and more massive BHs. Dwarf stars in such galaxies are swallowed whole by the BH and hence do not emit flares; giant stars could produce flares as often as every 105yr, although the rate depends sensitively on the shape of the stellar distribution function. We discuss the possibility of detecting disruption flares in current supernova searches. The total mass of stars consumed over the lifetime of the galaxy is of the order of 106Msolar, independent of galaxy luminosity; thus, disrupted stars may contribute significantly to the present BH mass in galaxies fainter than {\textasciitilde}109Lsolar.},

	abstract = {Massive binaries that merge as compact objects are the progenitors of gravitational-wave sources. Most of these binaries experience one or more phases of mass transfer, during which one of the stars loses all or part of its outer envelope and becomes a stripped-envelope star. The evolution of the size of these stripped stars is crucial in determining whether they experience further interactions and understanding their ultimate fate. We present new calculations of stripped-envelope stars based on binary evolution models computed with MESA. We use these to investigate their radius evolution as a function of mass and metallicity. We further discuss their pre-supernova observable characteristics and potential consequences of their evolution on the properties of supernovae from stripped stars. At high metallicity, we find that practically all of the hydrogen-rich envelope is removed, which is in agreement with earlier findings. Only progenitors with initial masses below 10 M⊙ expand to large radii (up to 100 R⊙), while more massive progenitors remain compact. At low metallicity, a substantial amount of hydrogen remains and the progenitors can, in principle, expand to giant sizes ({\textgreater} 400 R⊙) for all masses we consider. This implies that they can fill their Roche lobe anew. We show that the prescriptions commonly used in population synthesis models underestimate the stellar radii by up to two orders of magnitude. We expect that this has consequences for the predictions for gravitational-wave sources from double neutron star mergers, particularly with regard to their metallicity dependence.

	abstract = {Supermassive black holes can capture or disrupt stars that come suﬃciently close. This article reviews the dynamical processes by which stars or stellar remnants are placed onto loss-cone orbits and the implications for feeding rates. The capture rate is well deﬁned for spherical galaxies with nuclear relaxation times that are shorter than the galaxy’s age. However, even the dense nucleus of the Milky Way may be less than one relaxation time old, and this is certainly the case for more massive galaxies; the capture rate in such galaxies is an initial-value problem with poorlyknown initial conditions and the rate can be much higher, or much lower, than the rate in a collisionally relaxed nucleus. In nonspherical (axisymmetric, triaxial) galaxies, torquing of orbits by the mean ﬁeld can dominate perturbations due to random encounters, leading to much higher capture rates than in the spherical geometry, particularly in (massive) galaxies with long central relaxation times. Relativistic precession plays a crucial role in mediating the capture of compact remnants from regions very near to the black hole, by destroying the orbital correlations that would otherwise dominate the torques. The complex dynamics of relativistic loss cones are not yet well enough understood for accurate estimates of compact-object (“EMRI”) capture rates to be made.},

	abstract = {Methods. Here, we modeled the evolution of 252 single, nonrotating helium stars covering the initial mass range 0.8–3.5 M , with metallicities between Z = 10−4 and 0.02, and overshoot eﬃciency factors from fOV = 0.0 to 0.016 across all convective boundaries. We used these models to constrain several properties of these stars, including their central densities, compositions, envelope masses, and radii at the onset explosive oxygen ignition, as well as the ﬁnal outcome as a function of initial helium star mass. We further investigate the sensitivity of these properties to mass loss rate assumptions using an additional grid of 110 models with varying wind eﬃciencies.
Results. We ﬁnd that helium star models with masses between ∼1.8 and 2.7 M are able to evolve onto 1.35–1.37 M (C)ONe cores that initiate explosive burning at central densities between log10(ρc/g cm−3) ∼ 9.3 and 9.6. We constrained the amount of residual carbon retained after core carbon burning as a function of initial conditions, and conclude that it plays a critical role in determining the ﬁnal outcome: Chandrasekhar-mass degenerate cores that retain more than approximately 0.005 M of carbon result in (C)ONe SNe Ia, while those with lower carbon mass become ECSNe. We ﬁnd that (C)ONe SNe Ia are more likely to occur at high metallicities, whereas at low metallicities ECSNe dominate. However, both SN Ia and ECSN progenitors expand signiﬁcantly during the ﬁnal evolutionary stages, so that for the most extended models, a further binary interaction may occur. We constrain the relative ratio between (C)ONe SNe Ia and SNe Ib/c to be 0.17–0.30 at Z = 0.02, and 0.03–0.13 at Z ≤ 10−3.
Conclusions. We conclude with a discussion on potential observational properties of (C)ONe SNe Ia and their progenitors. In the few thousand years leading to the explosion, at least some progenitors should be identiﬁable as luminous metal-rich super-giants, embedded in hydrogen-free circumstellar nebulae.},

	abstract = {Mass loss processes are a key uncertainty in the evolution of massive stars. They determine the amount of mass and angular momentum retained by the star, thus influencing its evolution and presupernova structure. Because of the high complexity of the physical processes driving mass loss, stellar evolution calculations must employ parametric algorithms, and usually only include wind mass loss. We carried out an extensive parameter study of wind mass loss and its effects on massive star evolution using the open-source stellar evolution code MESA. We provide a systematic comparison of wind mass loss algorithms for solar-metallicity, nonrotating, single stars in the initial mass range of 15 M⊙ to 35 M⊙. We consider combinations drawn from two hot phase (I.e., roughly the main sequence) algorithms, three cool phase (I.e., post-main-sequence) algorithms, and two Wolf-Rayet mass loss algorithms. We discuss separately the effects of mass loss in each of these phases. In addition, we consider linear wind efficiency scale factors of 1, 0.33, and 0.1 to account for suggested reductions in mass loss rates due to wind inhomogeneities. We find that the initial to final mass mapping for each zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass has a 50\% uncertainty if all algorithm combinations and wind efficiencies are considered. The ad-hoc efficiency scale factor dominates this uncertainty. While the final total mass and internal structure of our models vary tremendously with mass loss treatment, final luminosity and effective temperature are much less sensitive for stars with ZAMS mass ≲ 30 M⊙. This indicates that uncertainty in wind mass loss does not negatively affect estimates of the ZAMS mass of most single-star supernova progenitors from pre-explosion observations. Our results furthermore show that the internal structure of presupernova stars is sensitive to variations in both main sequence and post main-sequence mass loss. The compactness parameter ξ ∝ ℳ /R(ℳ) has been identified as a proxy for the "explodability" of a given presupernova model. We find that ξ varies by as much as 30\% for models of the same ZAMS mass evolved with different wind efficiencies and mass loss algorithm combinations. This suggests that the details of the mass loss treatment might bias the outcome of detailed core-collapse supernova calculations and the predictions for neutron star and black hole formation.

	abstract = {Strong dynamical interactions among stars and compact objects are expected in a variety of astrophysical settings, such as star clusters and the disks of active galactic nuclei. Via a suite of 3D hydrodynamics simulations using the moving-mesh code AREPO, we investigate the formation of transient phenomena and their properties in close encounters between an \$2M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ or \$20M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ equal-mass circular binary star and single \$20M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ black hole (BH). Stars can be disrupted by the BH during dynamical interactions, naturally producing electromagnetic transient phenomena. Encounters with impact parameters smaller than the semimajor axis of the initial binary frequently lead to a variety of transients whose electromagnetic signatures are qualitatively different from those of ordinary disruption events involving just two bodies. These include the simultaneous or successive disruptions of both stars and one full disruption of one star accompanied by successive partial disruptions of the other star. On the other hand, when the impact parameter is larger than the semimajor axis of the initial binary, the binary is either simply tidally perturbed or dissociated into bound and unbound single stars ("micro-Hills" mechanism). The dissociation of \$20M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ binaries can produce a runaway star and an active BH moving away from one another. Also, the binary dissociation can either produce an interacting binary with the BH, or a non-interacting, hard binary; both could be candidates of BH high- and low-mass X-ray binaries. Hence our simulations especially confirm that strong encounters can lead to the formation of the (generally difficult to form) BH low-mass X-ray binaries.},

	abstract = {Massive stars that become stripped of their hydrogen envelope through binary interaction or winds can be observed either as Wolf-Rayet stars, if they have optically thick winds, or as transparent-wind stripped-envelope stars. We approximate their evolution through evolutionary models of single helium stars, and compute detailed model grids in the initial mass range 1.5 to 70 M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ for metallicities between 0.01 and 0.04, from core helium ignition until core collapse. Throughout their lifetime, some stellar models expose the ashes of helium burning. We propose that models that have nitrogen-rich envelopes are candidate WN stars, while models with a carbon-rich surface are candidate WC stars during core helium burning, and WO stars afterwards. We measure metallicity dependance of the total lifetime of our models and the duration of their evolutionary phases. We propose an analytic estimate of the wind optical depth to distinguish models of Wolf-Rayet stars from transparent-wind stripped-envelope stars, and find that the luminosity ranges at which WN, WC and WO type stars can exist is a strong function of metallicity. We find that all carbon-rich models produced in our grids have optically thick winds and match the luminosity distribution of observed populations. We construct population models and predict the numbers of transparent-wind stripped-envelope stars and Wolf-Rayet stars, and derive their number ratios at different metallicities. We find that as metallicity increases, the number of transparent-wind stripped-envelope stars decreases and the number of Wolf-Rayet stars increases. At high metallicities WC and WO type stars become more common. We apply our population models to nearby galaxies, and find that populations are more sensitive to the transition luminosity between Wolf-Rayet stars and transparent-wind helium stars than to the metallicity dependent mass loss rates.},

	abstract = {We explore full/partial tidal disruption events (TDEs) of stars/planets by stellar compact objects (black holes (BHs) or neutron stars (NSs)), which we term micro-TDEs. Disruption of a star/planet with mass M⋆ may lead to the formation of a debris disk around the BH/NS. Efficient accretion of a fraction of the debris may then give rise to bright, energetic, long (103–104 s), X-ray/gamma-ray flares, with total energies of up to erg, possibly resembling ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)/X-ray flashes (XRFs). The energy of such flares depends on the poorly constrained accretion processes. Significantly fainter flares might be produced if most of the disk mass is blown away through strong outflows. We suggest three dynamical origins for such disruptions. In the first, a star/planet is tidally disrupted following a close random encounter with a BH/NS in a dense cluster. We estimate the BH (NS) micro-TDE rates from this scenario to be a few (a few ) per Milky Way galaxy. Another scenario involves the interaction of wide companions due to perturbations by stars in the field, likely producing comparable but lower rates. Finally, a third scenario involves a BH/NS that gains a natal velocity kick at birth, leading to a close encounter with a binary companion and the tidal disruption of that companion. Such events could be associated with a supernova, or even with a preceding GRB/XRF event, and would likely occur hours to days after the prompt explosion; the rates of such events could be larger than those obtained from the other scenarios, depending on the preceding complex binary stellar evolution.},

MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP.

Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M sun star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

In this work, we assess the rates of standard total TDEs, destroying the entire star, and partial TDEs, in which a stellar remnant survives the interaction, by solving 1-D Fokker-Planck equations. Our rate estimates are based on a novel definition of the loss cone whose size is commensurate to the largest radius at which partial disruptions can occur, as motivated by relativistic hydrodynamical simulations. Our novel approach unveils two important results. First, partial TDEs can be more abundant than total disruptions by a factor of a few to a few tens. Second, the rates of complete stellar disruptions can be overestimated by a factor of a few to a few tens if one neglects partial TDEs, as we find that many of the events classified as total disruptions in the standard framework are in fact partial TDEs. Accounting for partial TDEs is particularly relevant for galaxies harbouring a nuclear stellar cluster featuring many events coming from the empty loss cone. Based on these findings, we stress that partial disruptions should be considered when constraining the luminosity function of TDE flares; accounting for this may reconcile the theoretically estimated TDE rates with the observed ones.},

The gaseous debris produced in a TDE can power a bright electromagnetic flare as it is accreted by the SMBH; so far, several dozen TDE candidates have been observed. For SMBHs with masses above ∼ 10{\textasciicircum}7 M\_⊙, the tidal disruption of solar-type stars occurs within ten gravitational radii of the SMBH, implying that general relativity (GR) is needed to describe gravity. Three promising signatures of GR in TDEs are: (1) a super-exponential cutoff in the volumetric TDE rate for SMBH masses above ∼ 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_⊙ due to direct capture of tidal debris by the event horizon, (2) delays in accretion disk formation (and a consequent alteration of the early-time light curve) caused by the effects of relativistic nodal precession on stream circularization, and (3) quasi-periodic modulation of X-ray emission due to global precession of misaligned accretion disks and the jets they launch. We review theoretical models and simulations of TDEs in Newtonian gravity, then describe how relativistic modifications give rise to these proposed observational signatures, as well as more speculative effects of GR.

The largest uncertainty arises due to the poorly constrained occupation fraction of SMBHs in low-mass galaxies, which otherwise dominate the total TDE rate. The detection rate of TDE flares by optical surveys is calculated as a function of SMBH mass and other observables for several physically motivated models of TDE emission. We also quantify the fraction of galaxies that produce deeply penetrating disruption events. If the majority of the detected events are characterized by super-Eddington luminosities (such as disc winds, or synchrotron radiation from an off-axis relativistic jet), then the measured SMBH mass distribution will tightly constrain the low-end SMBH occupation fraction. If Eddington-limited emission channels dominate, however, then the occupation fraction sensitivity is much less pronounced in a flux-limited survey (although still present in a volume-complete event sample). The SMBH mass distribution of the current sample of TDEs, though highly inhomogeneous and encumbered by selection effects, already suggests that Eddington-limited emission channels dominate. Even our most conservative rate estimates appear to be in tension with much lower observationally inferred TDE rates, and we discuss several possible resolutions to this discrepancy.},

	abstract = {Using a suite of fully relativistic hydrodynamic simulations applied to main-sequence stars with realistic internal density profiles, we examine full and partial tidal disruptions across a wide range of black hole mass ( \$\{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{5\}{\textbackslash}leqslant \{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BH\}\}/\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textbackslash}leqslant 5{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{7\}\$ ) and stellar mass ( \$0.3{\textbackslash}leqslant \{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}/\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textbackslash}leqslant 3\$ ) as larger MBH leads to stronger relativistic effects. For fixed M⋆, as MBH increases, the ratio of the maximum pericenter distance yielding full disruptions ( \$\{\{ {\textbackslash}mathcal R \}\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{t\}\}\}\$ ) to its Newtonian prediction rises rapidly, becoming triple the Newtonian value for \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BH\}\}=5{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{7\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ , while the ratio of the energy width of the stellar debris for full disruptions to the Newtonian prediction decreases steeply, resulting in a factor of 2 correction at \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BH\}\}=5{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{7\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ . We provide approximate formulae that express the relativistic corrections of both \$\{\{ {\textbackslash}mathcal R \}\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{t\}\}\}\$ and the energy width relative to their Newtonian approximate estimates. For partial disruptions, we find that the fractional remnant mass for a given ratio of the pericenter to \$\{\{ {\textbackslash}mathcal R \}\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{t\}\}\}\$ is higher for larger MBH. These results have several implications. As MBH increases above \${\textbackslash}sim \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{7\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ , the cross section for complete disruptions is suppressed by competition with direct capture. However, the cross-section ratio for partial to complete disruptions depends only weakly on MBH. The relativistic correction to the debris energy width delays the time of peak mass-return rate and diminishes the magnitude of the peak return rate. For \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BH\}\}rsim \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{7\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ , the MBH-dependence of the full disruption cross section and the peak mass-return rate and time is influenced more by relativistic effects than by Newtonian dynamics.},

Here we focus on the stellar mass dependence of the outcomes of partial disruptions. As the encounter becomes weaker, the debris mass is increasingly concentrated near the outer edges of the energy distribution. As a result, the mass fallback rate can deviate substantially from a t-5/3 power law, becoming more like a single peak with a tail declining as t-p with p ≃ 2-5. Surviving remnants are spun-up in the prograde direction and are hotter than main-sequence stars of the same mass. Their specific orbital energy is ≃10-3× that of the debris, but of either sign with respect to the black hole potential, while their specific angular momentum is close to that of the original star. Even for strong encounters, remnants have speeds at infinity relative to the black hole potential ≲300 km s-1, so they are unable to travel far out into the galactic bulge. The remnants most deeply bound to the black hole go through a second tidal disruption event upon their first return to pericenter; if they have not thermally relaxed, they will be completely disrupted.},

In the first paper, we gave an overview of this program and discussed the principal observational implications of our work. Here we describe our calculational method, which includes a new method for calculating fully relativistic stellar self-gravity, and provide details about the outcomes of full disruptions, focusing on the stellar mass dependence of the outcomes for a black hole of mass 106 M⊙. We consider eight different stellar masses, from 0.15 M⊙ to 10 M⊙. We find that, relative to the traditional order-of-magnitude estimate rt, the physical tidal radius of low-mass stars (M⋆ ≲ 0.7 M⊙) is larger by tens of percent, while for high-mass stars (M⋆ ≳ 1 M⊙) it is smaller by a factor of 2-2.5. The traditional estimate of the range of energies found in the debris is ≈1.4× too large for low-mass stars, but is a factor of ∼2 too small for high-mass stars; in addition, the energy distribution for high-mass stars has significant wings. For all stars undergoing tidal encounters, we find that mass loss continues for many stellar vibration times because the black hole's tidal gravity competes with the instantaneous stellar gravity at the star's surface until the star has reached a distance from the black hole ∼O(10)rt.},

Improvements in MESA star's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M ⊙ stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit that packages all the required components needed to form a unified, maintained, and well-validated build environment for MESA. We also highlight a few tools developed by the community for rapid visualization of MESA star results.},

Stars with M{\textless} 8 M⊙ become white dwarfs and cool to the point where the electrons are degenerate and the ions are strongly coupled, a realm now available to study with MESA due to improved treatments of element diffusion, latent heat release, and blending of equations of state. Studies of the final fates of massive stars are extended in MESA by our addition of an approximate Riemann solver that captures shocks and conserves energy to high accuracy during dynamic epochs. We also introduce a 1D capability for modeling the effects of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that, in combination with the coupling to a public version of the STELLA radiation transfer instrument, creates new avenues for exploring Type II supernova properties. These capabilities are exhibited with exploratory models of pair-instability supernovae, pulsational pair-instability supernovae, and the formation of stellar-mass black holes. The applicability of MESA is now widened by the capability to import multidimensional hydrodynamic models into MESA. We close by introducing software modules for handling floating point exceptions and stellar model optimization, as well as four new software tools - MESA-Web, MESA-Docker, pyMESA, and mesastar.org - to enhance MESA's education and research impact.},

	abstract = {Understanding ionizing fluxes of stellar populations is crucial for various astrophysical problems including the epoch of reionization. Short-lived massive stars are generally considered as the main stellar sources. We examine the potential role of less massive stars that lose their envelope through interaction with a binary companion. Here, we focus on the role of metallicity (Z). For this purpose we used the evolutionary code MESA and created tailored atmosphere models with the radiative transfer code CMFGEN. We show that typical progenitors, with initial masses of 12 M⊙, produce hot and compact stars ( 4 M⊙, 60-80 kK, 1 R⊙). These stripped stars copiously produce ionizing photons, emitting 60-85\% and 30-60\% of their energy as HI and HeI ionizing radiation, for Z = 0.0001-0.02, respectively. Their output is comparable to what massive stars emit during their Wolf-Rayet phase, if we account for their longer lifetimes and the favorable slope of the initial mass function. Their relative importance for reionization may be further favored since they emit their photons with a time delay ( 20 Myr after birth in our fiducial model). This allows time for the dispersal of the birth clouds, allowing the ionizing photons to escape into the intergalactic medium. At low Z, we find that Roche stripping fails to fully remove the H-rich envelope, because of the reduced opacity in the subsurface layers. This is in sharp contrast with the assumption of complete stripping that is made in rapid population synthesis simulations, which are widely used to simulate the binary progenitors of supernovae and gravitational waves. Finally, we discuss the urgency to increase the observed sample of stripped stars to test these models and we discuss how our predictions can help to design efficient observational campaigns.},

	abstract = {Stars stripped of their hydrogen-rich envelope through interaction with a binary companion are generally not considered when accounting for ionizing radiation from stellar populations, despite the expectation that stripped stars emit hard ionizing radiation, form frequently, and live 10-100 times longer than single massive stars. We compute the first grid of evolutionary and spectral models specially made for stars stripped in binaries for a range of progenitor masses (2-20 M⊙) and metallicities ranging from solar to values representative for pop II stars. For stripped stars with masses in the range 0.3-7 M⊙, we find consistently high effective temperatures (20 000-100 000 K, increasing with mass), small radii (0.2-1 R⊙), and high bolometric luminosities, comparable to that of their progenitor before stripping. The spectra show a continuous sequence that naturally bridges subdwarf-type stars at the low-mass end and Wolf-Rayet-like spectra at the high-mass end. For intermediate masses we find hybrid spectral classes showing a mixture of absorption and emission lines. These appear for stars with mass-loss rates of 10-8-10-6 M⊙ yr-1, which have semi-transparent atmospheres. At low metallicity, substantial hydrogen-rich layers are left at the surface and we predict spectra that resemble O-type stars instead. We obtain spectra undistinguishable from subdwarfs for stripped stars with masses up to 1.7 M⊙, which questions whether the widely adopted canonical value of 0.47 M⊙ is uniformly valid. Only a handful of stripped stars of intermediate mass have currently been identified observationally. Increasing this sample will provide necessary tests for the physics of interaction, internal mixing, and stellar winds. We use our model spectra to investigate the feasibility to detect stripped stars next to an optically bright companion and recommend systematic searches for their UV excess and possible emission lines, most notably HeII λ4686 in the optical and HeII λ1640 in the UV. Our models are publicly available for further investigations or inclusion in spectral synthesis simulations.

We recently presented the discovery of the first set of such stripped stars in a companion paper. Here, we fit the spectra of ten stars with new atmosphere models in order to constrain their stellar properties precisely. We find that the stellar properties align well with the theoretical expectations from binary evolution models for helium-core burning envelope-stripped stars. The fits confirm that the stars have high effective temperatures (Teff{\textasciitilde}50-100kK), high surface gravities (log g {\textasciitilde}5), and hydrogen-poor/helium-rich surfaces (X(H, surf){\textasciitilde}0-0.4) while showing for the first time a range of bolometric luminosities (10{\textasciicircum}3-10{\textasciicircum}5 Lsun), small radii ({\textasciitilde}0.5-1Rsun), and low Eddington factors (Gamma\_e{\textasciitilde}0.006-0.4). Using these properties, we derive intermediate current masses ({\textasciitilde}1-8Msun), which suggest that their progenitors were massive stars ({\textasciitilde}5-25Msun) and that a subset will reach core-collapse, leaving behind neutron stars or black holes. Using the model fits, we also estimate the emission rates of ionizing photons for these stars, which agree well with previous model expectations. Further, by computing models for a range of mass-loss rates, we find that the stellar winds are weaker than predicted by any existing scheme (Mdot(wind){\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1e-9 Msun/yr). The properties of this first sample of intermediate mass helium stars suggest they both contain progenitors of type Ib and IIb supernovae, and provide important benchmarks for binary evolution and population synthesis models.},

At large amplitudes, these pulsations substantially modify the outer envelope's density structure encountered by the outgoing shock wave from the eventual core collapse of these M {\textgreater} 9 M\_\{⊙\} stars. Using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we model the effects of fundamental mode and first overtone pulsations in the RSG envelopes and the resulting Type IIP supernovae (SNe) using MESA+STELLA. We find that, in the case of fundamental mode pulsations, SN plateau observables, such as the luminosity at day 50, L50; time-integrated shock energy, ET; and plateau duration, tp, are consistent with radial scalings derived considering explosions of nonpulsating stars. Namely, most of the effect of the pulsation is consistent with the behavior expected for a star of a different size at the time of explosion. However, in the case of overtone pulsations, the Lagrangian displacement is not monotonic. Therefore, in such cases, excessively bright or faint SN emission at different times reflects the underdense or overdense structure of the emitting region near the SN photosphere.},

MESA can now simultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating stars undergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum, greatly enhancing the prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully coupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning stages needed to construct supernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips for massive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates “on-the-fly” from input nuclear data allows better simulation of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy elements in hot stars. We close by noting that the MESA software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit consistency for all results across all the supported platforms, a profound enabling capability for accelerating MESA's development.},

	abstract = {We consider the destructive effects of encounters between binaries and red giant stars in the Galactic Centre. Such encounters may explain the observed depletion of luminous red giants within the central 0.2pc of the galaxy. We consider encounters involving 2- and 8-Msolar red giants, and thus span the range of stellar masses contributing to the most luminous red giants observed in the Galactic Centre. To explore the phase space of encounters thoroughly, we simulate 18x10{\textasciicircum}3 encounters using a modified four-body code in which the red giant core and components of the binary are treated as point masses, and where the envelope configuration is assumed to remain static throughout the encounter. We then rerun a small number of encounters with a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code to confirm the reliability of conclusions drawn from the four-body runs. We see two possible pathways to red giant destruction. A large fraction of encounters lead to the formation of common-envelope systems, where two compact objects (drawn from the red giant core and the components of the original binary) form a binary within a common gaseous envelope, whilst the third body is ejected. The destruction of the red giant will then follow when the envelope is ejected as the binary hardens. In a smaller number of encounters, the intruding binary passes through the star and ejects the red giant core from the envelope. The red giant envelope will then disperse on short time-scales. We compute the time-scales for both of these processes to occur in the Galactic Centre for a variety of binary populations.},
