The following are the main key points from this [guide](https://backlinko.com/on-page-seo).

- Google crawls websites for keywords and puts more weight on terms that show up early on your page: use main keyword once in the first 100-150 words of your article. In the rest of the article, use the keywords multiple times.
- Wrap titles properly (h1, h2...).
- Question-based title tags have an above average CTR (Click-through-rate).
- Use internal and external links.
- Link building: make short URLS and include keywords in them.
- Use unique, keyword-rich meta descriptions. Example: This is a `content overview`. Learn how to get `specific benefit` from this `content description`.
- Do not use stock images!
- Give descriptive filenames and alt text to images.
- Create FAQ pages: people use voice search, and Google pulls the results from FAQ pages.
