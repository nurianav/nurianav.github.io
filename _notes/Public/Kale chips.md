Grab a bowl and dump into it:
- Crashed cashews
- Nutritional yeast
- Lemon
- Tamari
- Olive oil
- Curry

Add the sauce to the kale, try not to wet them too much (we want them crispy) and put them into the oven! 

(This recipe is best with a dehydrator instead of an oven. To get a similar effect, one should set the oven to the minimum temperature and give it a lot of time).
